# apocalypse:misc.toml
# This config contains misc settings; a bit of this and a bit of that.

  # Block List fields: General format = [ "namespace:block_name[property1=value1,...]", ... ]
  #   Block lists are arrays of blocks and partial block states.
  #   Blocks are defined by their key in the block registry, usually following the pattern 'namespace:block_name'.
  #   An asterisk '*' can be used to match all blocks belonging to X namespace. For example, 'minecraft:*' will match
  #     all vanilla blocks.
  #   Block tags can also be used here. To declare a tag, start with a '#' followed by the rest of the tag path.
  #   Tag example: '#minecraft:beehive_inhabitors'
  #   List entries by default match any block state. The block states to match can be narrowed down by specifying
  #     properties. The syntax for block state properties is the same as for commands. Any properties not specified will
  #     match any value. For example, 'minecraft:beehive[honey_level=5]' will match any full beehives, regardless of the
  #     direction they face.
  #   Note that tags and namespace entries are not block state sensitive; they only care about the base block
  #       Priority order: specific entries > tag entries > namespace entries
